# IEEE Python Programming Workshop

For this Python Programming workshop, I developed a Space Invaders game and went over parts of the code during our presentation to show our members the basics of the programming language.

The workshop is linked here: [Introduction to Python Programming](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10v2CBAVuZreqAoHLPcvSPy7J5Rfgn8A89tYdObnG7EA/edit#slide=id.p)

Below is a snapshot of how the game looks after opening it through the workshop steps:
